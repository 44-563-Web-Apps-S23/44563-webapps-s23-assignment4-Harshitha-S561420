<h1>Harshitha snips a play</h1>
<h4>SAM AVERAGE _Percy Mackaye</h4>
<p>_Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
    from its standard._</p>
    <p>_Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
    hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.</p>

   <p> _On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
    blanket thrown about his shoulders_.</p>


<h4><p></h4>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!</p>

    <p>[_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._</p>

<h4><p></h4>ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.</p>

<h4><p></h4>JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.</p>

<h4><p></h4>ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?</p>

<p>JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.</p>

<p>ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._</p>

<p>JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</p>
